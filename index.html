      <h2>Cobalt SS/TC Description</h2>
      <p>
        Only 3,168 Cobalt SS Turbo Coupes were ever manufactured, making it one of the rarest vehicles produced by GM.
        This was GM's entry into the tuner market, shifting from the supercharged LSJ to the turbocharged LNF engine in 2007.
        The car also included a 24 mm front stabilizer bar, 22 mm rear stabilizer bar, F35-tuned suspension, and a limited-slip differential.
        Due to this switch, the Cobalt SS/TC holds the record for the fastest front-wheel drive production car lap at the Nürburgring Nordschleife,
        clocking 8:22.85. This vehicle prioritized performance over appearance, resulting in limited mainstream appeal. Production ended in 2010.

    <h3>De-Cal Premium Graphics</h3>
    <p>
      De-Cal has done all the custom livery on my car. People often think this type of work is too costly, but that couldn't be further from 
      the truth. All the work you see on the "Phantom SS" was under $1,000 — and as you can see, the entire car has been done! Logan is a truly 
      talented artist and can help you with any design. He collaborates with you every step of the way to ensure you get exactly what you want. 
      He also provides mockups ahead of time, so you can see the design before installation. The service and pricing are unbeatable — just

    <h3>All Car Repair</h3>
    <p>
      Every time I had to do modifications beyond my skill level, I would go to a shop. I always made sure to go to a different shop each time 
      to compare service. That process ended after I went to All Car Repair. All Car Repair is the only shop I trust with my mechanical work.
      I have been going to them for everything from boost leaks, struts, engine/transmission mounts, and more.
      Tyrell and his team offer precision, honest advice, and excellent turnaround time. I cannot personally recommend them enough
