            <p>
                I have been customizing vehicles for some time now. I have always had a passion for making my vehicle unique.
                While I was in the military, I had to move around a lot and never stayed in one place for more than a few months.
                This made having something personal very important to me. I focused that passion on my vehicle, as it was generally
                the only constant that I had at the time.
            </p>
