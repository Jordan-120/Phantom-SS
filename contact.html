            <p>
                I have been modding vehicles for as long as I can remember. Since I’ve moved around so much, 
                my vehicle has been my only constant. Because of this, it was important for my vehicles to truly 
                feel like mine. This is what inspired my level of customization and attention to detail. All my vehicles 
                have been made to be one of a kind and truly unique. As I’ve progressed, this has become even more evident. 
                I’ve reached a level where I’ve been offered multiple sponsorships and have attended various shows and competitions. 
                I’m proud to say I’ve earned several awards—and I anticipate many more in the near future.
            </p>
